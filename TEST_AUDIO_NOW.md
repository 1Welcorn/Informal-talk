## 🧪 How to Test Audio

### Test 1: Understanding Section (Easiest Test)

1. **Go to your app:** https://app-checkout-1.preview.emergentagent.com

2. **Sign in with Google** (if not already signed in)

3. **Click "01. Understanding"**

4. **Look for speaker icons** (🔊) next to phrases

5. **Click a speaker icon**

6. **You should hear audio!** ✅
   - English pronunciation of the phrase
   - Generated by Gemini AI text-to-speech

---

### Test 2: Dialogue Practice (Interactive Audio)

1. **Click "02. Practicing"**

2. **Click "Cenários de Prática"**

3. **Select any dialogue** (e.g., "'Gotta' at the Mall")

4. **Click on correct answers**

5. **Audio should play automatically** when you select correct words! ✅

---

### Test 3: Formality Practice

1. **Click "02. Practicing"**

2. **Click "Formal vs. Informal"**

3. **Select an answer**

4. **Audio feedback should play** ✅

---

## ✅ What Should Happen

### If Working Correctly:

**In Understanding Section:**
- 🔊 Speaker icons are visible
- Click them → hear English pronunciation
- Clear, natural-sounding voice (Gemini TTS)

**In Dialogue Practice:**
- Select correct answer → audio plays automatically
- Hears the completed sentence spoken
- Smooth, natural speech

**In Browser Console (F12):**
- No "API key" errors
- No "Failed to generate audio" errors
- May see some loading messages (normal)

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: No Audio Playing

**Check:**
1. Is your device volume up?
2. Are you using headphones? Check they're connected
3. Try clicking multiple times (first audio may take a moment to load)

**Solution:**
- Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Check browser console (F12) for errors
- Make sure you're signed in

---

### Issue 2: "Failed to generate audio" Error

**Check console (F12) for the specific error:**

**If you see: "API key not valid"**
- The API key might be incorrect
- Check: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
- Verify the key is active

**If you see: "Quota exceeded"**
- You've hit the rate limit (15 requests/minute)
- Wait 1 minute and try again
- This is normal for testing, won't happen in production

**If you see: "Network error"**
- Check your internet connection
- Refresh the page

---

### Issue 3: Audio Is Slow to Load

**This is normal for the FIRST audio:**
- Gemini API generates audio on-demand
- First request: ~2-3 seconds
- Subsequent requests: Cached, instant!

**The app has smart caching:**
- Audio is cached in IndexedDB
- Same phrase = instant playback
- No need to regenerate

---

## 📊 Understanding How Audio Works

### Audio Generation Process:

1. **User clicks speaker or selects answer**
2. **App checks cache:** Do we have this audio already?
   - Yes → Play instantly from cache ✅
   - No → Request from Gemini API
3. **Gemini generates audio** (~1-2 seconds)
4. **Audio is saved to cache** for next time
5. **Audio plays** for the user

### Caching Strategy:

- **First time:** Slight delay while generating
- **Second time:** Instant playback from cache
- **Cache persists** across sessions
- **Efficient & fast** user experience

## 💰 Your Gemini API Usage

### Free Tier Limits:
